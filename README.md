# Awake
Have you ever wanted to prevent your mobile phone's screen from sleeping? Say you want to read an eBook or your an android developer and want to debug your app on a device, what you probably will do is go to display settings and set the time to sleep from there. And when you are done, you go back and set it to previous value again isn't it?
That pain is over. "Awake" is a simple floating widget that will hold your screen until you say stop. It's user friendly and works smoothly. This widget can overlay on any application, such as your pdf viewer.
